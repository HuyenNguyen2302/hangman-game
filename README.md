This is my solution to the hangman game assignment for the course CS 106A (Stanford).

Assignment handout: http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106a/cs106a.1124/handouts/200%20Assignment%204.pdf

** How to play this game:
The computer chooses a random word from the word bank.
The player has to guess what the word is.
If the whole hangman is drawn, the player loses.
Words that have not been guessed correctly show up right below the word that is being guessed. 

** Note: uppercase and lowercase letters are both fine, but only the first letter is processed if more than one letter is entered.
